Look in generate_wave.py to see how to generate a sin wave and play it as a sound  
> Challenge: can you change it to a higher pitch? What about a lower pitch?  
> Challenge: can you increase the lenth of the sound?  

Look in add_waves.py to see how it is possible to add 2 waves together  
Look at the graph and see how they were added together
> Challenge: can you add 3 waves together, what about 4, or 5?

Look at spectrum.py to see the spectrum of a wave
> Challenge: can you increase the higher frequencies to have a higher amplitude?  
> Challenge: what happens when you add more waves to the mix?  

Look at read_audio.py to see how to read in an audio file  
> Challenge: read in other files and see how their spectrum is different  
# TODO - WILL THIS WORK WITH NON WAVE FILES?  

Look at filter.py to see how a filter works  
> Challenge: filter out different notes  
> Challenge: try to filter more or less of the notes  
> Challenge: switch the low pass filter to a high pass filter
